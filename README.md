# OpenMM Simulated annealing

Simulated annealing performed using OpenMM.

The [standard-openmm-distribution](standard-openmm-distribution) folder shows a
simulation set up with the built-in tools that come with OpenMM, while the
[opls-mstools](opls-mstools) folder uses the [mstools](https://github.com/z-gong/ms-tools) package to generate more
complex examples that enable polarisable simulations.
