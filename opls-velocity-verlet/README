# Structure generation

Creation of simulation files is handled via the [mstools package](https://github.com/z-gong/ms-tools),
so ensure this is installed prior to running `create_openmm.py`.

Many types of labelled geometry files cna be used including xyz, zmat or pdb formats. Forcefield files must be accepted by `mstools`, so an fftool-compatible format is recommended. If virtual sites are
required (i.e. for TIP4P or SWM4-NDP water models), the zfp style must be used as the fftool format doesn't support virtual sites.
An fftool forcefield can be converted to a zfp style with the ffconv script distributed with the mstools package, to allow for combination with other files that include virtual site terms.
